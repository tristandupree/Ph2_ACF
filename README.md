CMS Ph2 ACF (Acquisition & Control Framework) 
======================================

__Contains:__

- A middleware API layer, implemented in C++, which wraps the firmware calls and handshakes into abstracted functions

- A C++ object-based library describing the system components (CBCs,
Hybrids, Boards) and their properties(values, status)

- several utilities (like visitors to execute certain tasks for each item in the hierarchical Item description)

- a tools/ directory with several utilities (currently: calibration, hybrid testing, common-mode analysis)

- some applications: datatest, interfacetest, hybridtest, system, calibrate

Different versions
---------------------------------------

On this Repo, you can find different version of the software :
- a hopefully working and stable version on the master branch

Setup
-----------------

Firmware for the GLIB can be found in /firmware. Since the "old" FMC flavour is deprecated, only new FMCs (both connectors on the same side) are supported.

NOTE: If you are doing the install for the first time on the latest [VM v1.1.0] (http://sbgcmstrackerupgrade.in2p3.fr/) then follow the preliminary setup, otherwise you can skip this.

1. Remove the current gcc and old boost libraries:

        sudo yum remove devtoolset-1.1-gcc-debuginfo
        sudo yum remove boost

2. Install the latest gcc compiler:

        sudo yum install devtoolset-2
        sudo ln -s /opt/rh/devtoolset-2/root/usr/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
        hash -r

   This should give you gcc 4.8.1:

        gcc --version

3. Finally, update uHAL to version 2.3:

        sudo yum groupremove uhal
        wget http://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/export/28265/tags/ipbus_sw/uhal_2_3_0/scripts/release/cactus.slc5.x86_64.repo 
        (You may need the --no-check-certificate)

	
        sudo cp cactus.slc5.x86_64.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/cactus.repo
        sudo yum clean all
        sudo yum groupinstall uhal

4. Re-compile ROOT using the new gcc 4.8: [Instructions](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/installing-root-source) - make sure to use "fixed location installation"


Note: You may also need to set the environment variables:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cactus/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PATH=/opt/cactus/bin:$PATH


The Ph2_ACF Software : 
----------------------------------

Follow these instructions to install and compile the libraries:
(provided you installed the latest version of gcc, µHal, boost as mentioned above)

1. Clone the GitHub repo.

2. Do a make in the root of the repo (make sure you have all µHal, root, boost... libraries on your computer).

3. Launch 
        
        systemtest --help
     
     command if you want to test the parsing of the HWDescription.xml file

4. Launch

        datatest --help
        
    command if you want to test if you can correctly read data.

6. Launch

        calibrate --help

    to calibrate a hybrid,

        hybridtest --help

    to test a hybird's I2C registers and input channel connectivity

        cmtest --help

    to run the CM noise study


7. an example of how to use visitors can be found in src/interfacetest.cc or in the HybridTester class


__What can you do with the software ?__

At the moment the package provides the following features:

- Configure the Glib & Cbcs
- Manipulate the registers in the Glib
- Manipulate the registers in the Cbcs
- Read Data
- Calibrate Hybrids
- Validate Hybrids
- Perform CM noise tests
- user external trigger and clock signals for your tests
- any other routine you want to implement yourself ... 


__Nota Bene:__
When you write a register in the Glib or the Cbc, the corresponding map of the HWDescription object in memory is also updated, 
so that you always have an exact replica of the HW Status in the memory.

Register values are:
- 8-bit unsigend integers for the CBCs that should be edited in hex notation, i.e. '0xFF'
- 32-bit unsigned integers for the GLIB: decimal values

For debugging purpose, you can activate DEV_FLAG in the sources or in the Makefile and also activate the uHal log in RegManager.cc.


__External Clock and Trigger:__

In order to use external Clock and Trigger functionality, a DIO5 mezzanine is required. It is available from the [CERN OHR](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-dio-5chttla) and sold by several commercial vendors.
For instructions on how to use it, see this [file](https://github.com/gauzinge/Ph2_ACF/blob/Dev/doc/TK_DAQ_MONO_GLIB3_FMCDIO5_v3.0_09-12-2014.pdf). The [firmware](https://github.com/gauzinge/Ph2_ACF/tree/Dev/firmware) is included in this repository.

Known Issues:
---------------------
Several bugs / problematic behavior has been reported by various users that is not direclty linked to the Ph2_ACF libraries, however, some workarounds are provided:

- When configuring a CBC object (writing all registers at once), the MSB of the Register "FrontEncControl" is read back incorrectly. This only manifests in electron mode (0xC3 instead of 0x43). The cause of this problem is identified as a FW artefact and the error itself can be safely ignored until the problem is solved. The chips will still properly configure and data quality should not be affected.

- uHAL exceptions and UDP timeouts when reading larger packet sizes from the GLIB board: 
    this can happen for some users (cause not yet identified) but can be circumvented by changing the line

        "ipbusudp-2.0://192.168.000.175:50001"

    in the connections.xml file to

        "chtcp-2.0://localhost:10203?target=192.168.000.175:50001"

    & then launching the CACTUS control hub by the command:

        /opt/cactus/bin/controlhub_start

    This uses TCP protocol instead of UDP which accounts for packet loss but decreases the performance.

- SegmentationViolations on lines that contain
        
        gStyle->Set ... ;

    statements. This has been observed by several users on the VM and can be fixed by re-compiling ROOT using GCC 4.8
